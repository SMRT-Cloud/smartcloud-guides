### Update Bootstrap Guide

Assuming the masternode is defaulted to a single masternode on a single vps.

To install bootstrap for smart cloud, copy and paste the below commands into your linux terminal:
* cd && bash -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SMRT-Cloud/smartcloud-guides/master/guides/update-bootstrap.sh)"

By running the above script, it will auto stop the masternode, download and extracts the bootstrap files at point 140k then loads the masternode and sync up.


You are now Bootstrapped!
